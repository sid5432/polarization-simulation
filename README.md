# polarization-simulation

These are small programs to simulate the state-of-polarization (SOP) of 

1. an optical plane wave (polarization_sim.py),

2. the SOP of light passing through a polarization maintaining (PM) optical fiber patchcord
(per_sim.py), and

3. the SOP of light passing thorugh a PM optical fiber (pmfiber_sim.py)

For details on what these are all about, please see
my blog posts [part 1](http://morethanfootnotes.blogspot.com/2015/08/notes-on-measuring-polarization.html?view=sidebar)
and

at [http://morethanfootnotes.blogspot.com](http://morethanfootnotes.blogspot.com/).

The programs are Python scripts, and require [numpy](http://www.numpy.org), [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and
[mayavi](http://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/).
